## Flying Doug
#### Background
Flying Doug is a clone of [Doodle Jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doodle_Jump) written in javascript using canvas.  Sprites are used for the game images.

The user will guide Doug the Pug's horizontal jump direction while Doug will jump upward by himself.  The user's score will continue to increase as long as Doug keeps jumping from platform to platform.  The game will conclude when Doug stops flying in the upward direction.

## Functionality & MVP
- Start and reset the game
- Use the left and right arrow keys to move Doug
- White platforms perform a normal jump while rainbow color platforms perform a super jump.
- Scoring
- Production README
