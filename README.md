## Background
Flying Doug is a clone of the popular game [Doodle Jump](http://doodlejump.org/).

Every time the main character lands on a platform, it is projected upward in hopes to reach a higher platform. The game is over when main character misses a platform and goes skydiving.   

## Implementation
- JavaScript
- Canvas

## Controls/Scoring
- Use the left and right arrow keys to move Doug.
- Blue platforms will project Doug at a normal distance.
- Pink platforms will allow the Doug to perform a super jump.
- The amount of bones Doug collects is the overall score.

- Implement moving platforms and platforms that disappear.
